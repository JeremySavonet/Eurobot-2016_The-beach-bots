/* 
 * Implements static obstacle avoidance.
 *
 * The algorithm is based on the "visible point" algorithm.
 * There are 3 inputs:
 *   - the play ground ( basically the table, here a rectangle )
 *   - the objects to avoid, represented by polygones 
 *   - start/stop points ( A, B )
 *
 * The algorithm will first find every ray formed by 2 points that can
 * "see" each others. Basically, if a polygon is between two points,
 * they cannot see each others. A side of a polygon is composed by 2
 * points that can se each others.
 *
 * From all these rays, we can create a graph. We affect for each ray
 * a weight with its own length.
 *
 * The algorithm executes Dijkstra to find the shortest path to go
 * from A to B.
 */

/*
 * As we run on 4Ko ram uC, we have static structures arrays to store:
 *  - MAX_POLY => represent the maximum polygons to avoid in the area.
 *  - MAX_PTS => maximize the sum of every polygons vertices.
 *  - MAX_RAYS => maximum number of rays. 
 *  - MAX_CHKPOINTS => maximum accepted checkpoints in the resulting path.
